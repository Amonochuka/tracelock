# TraceLock – Backend (Go + PostgreSQL)

TraceLock is a backend service for tracking access events and zone activity in real time.  
It is designed as a clean, production-style Go API with PostgreSQL and a modular internal
architecture.

This project is being built incrementally with professional backend practices:
small features, clear commits, and environment-based configuration.

---

## Current Features (so far)

- PostgreSQL database schema

- Go project layout using `cmd/` and `internal/`

- Database connection using environment variables

- User registration endpoint

- Secure password hashing using bcrypt

- Health endpoint

## Environment Variables

The API uses environment variables for database configuration:

```bash
export DB_HOST=localhost
export DB_PORT=5432
export DB_USER=tracelock_user
export DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
export DB_NAME=tracelock

## Database Schema

  - The database is created using SQL migrations in:

    - migrations/tables.sql

  - Current tables:

    - users

    - zones

    - access_events

    - active_sessions

## Running the API

  - From the project root:

    - go run ./cmd/api

If the connection is successful, the server will start and log:

  - Connected to database successfully!

## Health Check

GET /health

Response:
ok

## User Registration
Endpoint
POST /register

Body
{
  "name": "Amon",
  "email": "amon@example.com",
  "password": "mypassword"
}

Example
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Amon","email":"amon@example.com","password":"mypassword"}'

## Password Handling

Passwords are never stored in plain text.

They are hashed using:

golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt

before being stored in the database.

## Important PostgreSQL Permission Issue (Solved)

While testing registration, the following error occurred:

pq: permission denied for table users

What this meant

The database connection was working correctly, but the database user did not have
permission to access the tables.

In this setup:

Tables were created using the PostgreSQL superuser:

postgres


The application connects using:

tracelock_user


In PostgreSQL, granting access to a database does not automatically grant access
to tables inside the database.

This is a very common PostgreSQL pitfall.
## How it was fixed

The solution was to grant privileges on all existing tables and sequences
to the application user.

Login as the PostgreSQL superuser:

sudo -u postgres psql


Connect to the TraceLock database:

\c tracelock


Then run:

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO tracelock_user;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO tracelock_user;


After this, the API was able to insert users successfully.

Why both TABLES and SEQUENCES are needed

PostgreSQL uses sequences for SERIAL / auto-increment columns.

Without permissions on sequences, inserts may fail even if table permissions exist.

🛠 Tech Stack

Go

PostgreSQL

chi router

bcrypt

standard database/sql package

install JWT
Login Endpoint + JWT
go get github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5


JWT = JSON Web Token

That’s the full name.

Break it down simply:

✅ JSON

Because the data inside the token is a JSON object.

Example payload (conceptually):

{
  "sub": 12,
  "role": "admin"
}

✅ Web

Because it’s designed to be used over HTTP / web APIs.

✅ Token

Because it is a small string that represents:

“this user is authenticated”

and is sent with every request.

So:

JSON Web Token = a signed JSON object used as an authentication token for web APIs.
